# PriceIt

This application is built to track the different pricing of goods by category. This makes it easy for a user to know what is a good deal when shopping. It requires a user to add new items to a category and keep it updated when they see a price that is higher then the max price or lower then the min price of an item.

This was created for personal use as I find it hard to remember what pricing is a good deal and what isn't. If I can have a ball park figure were I know Is a good price and what is bad it will make shopping for a budget easier.

Items can be added to by category so you dont need to spend as much time searching for a specific item.

# Things that can be added later are:
- Weight conversion
- sorting
- searching for specific item
- Items having multiple categories
- Add visual elements and none default layout

# Known Bugs
- Item can be added from a different Category list
- modify button not correctly displayed
